Hi!

... and welcome to statichost.eu! Unfortunately, I see that your site 
`SITENAME` is not building correctly.

Specifically, cloning your repository failed due to an authentication error. I'm
guessing your repository is private, in which case you need to add a deploy key
to the repository in order for the build to work. The deploy key can be found in
the dashboard (not included here for security). For more information, see:
https://www.statichost.eu/docs/git/#private-repositories

Find your deploy key and other details in the dashboard:
https://builder.statichost.eu/

Please let me know if there's anything I can do for you! I'm happy to help in
any way I can. I'd also really appreciate it if you would comment on how you
plan to use statichost.eu and how your experience so far has been. No pressure,
though :)

Take care, and best regards,
Eric
