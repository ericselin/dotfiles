Hi!

... and welcome to statichost.eu! I see that you got your site `SITENAME`
configured and deployed, which is great! Just as a reminder: your site is
online at https://SITENAME.statichost.eu/ and can be managed at
https://builder.statichost.eu/.

Is there anything you're wondering or anything you need for your site? I'd also
really appreciate it if you would comment on how you plan to use statichost.eu
and how your experience so far has been. No pressure, though :)

Please let me know if there's anything I can do for you! I'm happy to help in
any way I can.

Take care, and best regards,
Eric
