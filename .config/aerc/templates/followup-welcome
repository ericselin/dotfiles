Hi again,

Just wanted to check in to see if there's anything I can do for you? Do you have
everything you need for your static site? Please let me know if you
have any questions or comments at all. :)

If you've decided not to move forward with statichost.eu, I completely
understand. Just let me know, so I won’t bother you unnecessarily. However, I’d
really appreciate a quick note on what led to that decision, so we can do better
in the future.

All the best!
Eric
